(* The diff type of a record follows the same pattern as the diff type of a tuple

   The diff for

   type 'a t = { x : X.t ; y : Y.t ; ... }

   will be:

   {[type ('a, 'a_diff) single =
       | X of X.Diff.t
       | Y of Y.Diff.t
       (* etc *)

     type ('a, 'a_diff) t = private ('a, 'a_diff) single list
   ]}

   The entries in the list are guaranteed to be sorted and unique (i.e at most one per field)

   There is a special case for a diff with one field: we don't return a list, just the one
   single element.
